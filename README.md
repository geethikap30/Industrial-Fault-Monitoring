# Industrial-Fault-Monitoring

This project uses a NodeMCU ESP8266 to monitor temperature and humidity levels in an industrial or server room environment. The data is collected using a DHT11 sensor and sent to ThingSpeak, an IoT cloud platform, for real-time monitoring and visualization.

## Features
- *Real-time Data Monitoring:* Continuously monitors temperature and humidity.
- *Cloud Integration:* Sends the collected data to ThingSpeak for visualization.
- *WiFi Connectivity:* Uses NodeMCU ESP8266 to connect to a WiFi network and transmit data.
## Hardware Requirements
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires
- Power Supply (e.g., USB cable)
## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- ESP8266 Board Package.
- DHT Sensor Library.
